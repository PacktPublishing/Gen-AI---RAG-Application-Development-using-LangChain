    "\n",
    "- `Transform Loaders`: These loaders handle different input formats and transform them into the Document format. For instance, consider a CSV file named \"data.csv\" with columns for \"name\" and \"age\". Using the CSVLoader, you can load the CSV data into Documents.\n",
    "- `Public Dataset or Service Loaders`: LangChain provides loaders for popular public sources, allowing quick retrieval and creation of Documents. For example, the WikipediaLoader can load content from Wikipedia.\n",
    "- `Proprietary Dataset or Service Loaders`: These loaders are designed to handle proprietary sources that may require additional authentication or setup. For instance, a loader could be created specifically for loading data from an internal database or an API with proprietary access."

From a theoretical point of view Probably approximately correct learning provides a framework for describing machine learning.\\n\\n\\n== History and relationships to other fields ==\\n\\nThe term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence. The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period.Although the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes. In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior, in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells. Hebb\\'s model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes.By the early 1960s an experimental \"learning machine\" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyze sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning. It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a \"goof\" button to cause it to re-evaluate incorrect decisions. A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson\\'s book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P,  improves with experience E.\" This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing\\'s proposal in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machin'"

I SPENT THE LAST YEAR SHOOTING A SHOW CALLED \"THE LAST OF US\" ON HBO. FOR SOME HBO SHOES, YOU GET TO SHOOT IN A FIVE STAR ITALIAN RESORT SURROUNDED BY BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, BUT I SAID, NO, THAT\\'S TOO EASY. I WANT TO SHOOT IN A FREEZING CANADIAN FOREST WHILE BEING CHASED AROUND BY A GUY WHOSE HEAD LOOKS LIKE A GENITAL WART. IT IS AN HONOR BEING A PART OF THESE HUGE FRANCHISEs LIKE \"GAME OF THRONES\" AND \"STAR WARS,\" BUT I\\'M STILL GETTING USED TO PEOPLE RECOGNIZING ME. THE OTHER DAY, A GUY STOPPED ME ON THE STREET AND SAYS, MY SON LOVES \"THE MANDALORIAN\" AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW, I\\'M FACE TIMING WITH A 6-YEAR-OLD WHO HAS NO IDEA WHO I AM BECAUSE MY CHARACTER WEARS A MASK THE ENTIRE SHOW. THE GUY IS LIKE, DO THE MANDO VOICE, BUT IT\\'S LIKE A BEDROOM VOICE. WITHOUT THE MASK, IT JUST SOUNDS PORNY. PEOPLE WALKING BY ON THE STREET SEE ME WHISPERING TO A 6-YEAR-OLD KID. I CAN BRING YOU IN WARM, OR I CAN BRING YOU IN COLD. EVEN THOUGH I CAME TO THE U.S. WHEN I WAS LITTLE, I WAS BORN IN CHILE, AND I HAVE 34 FIRST COUSINS WHO ARE STILL THERE. THEY\\'RE VERY PROUD OF ME. I KNOW THEY\\'RE PROUD BECAUSE THEY GIVE MY PHONE NUMBER TO EVERY PERSON THEY MEET, WHICH MEANS EVERY DAY, SOMEONE IN SANTIAGO WILL TEXT ME STUFF LIKE, CAN YOU COME TO MY WEDDING, OR CAN YOU SING MY PRIEST HAPPY BIRTHDAY, OR IS BABY YODA MEAN IN REAL LIFE. SO I HAVE TO BE LIKE NO, NO, AND HIS NAME IS GROGU. BUT MY COUSINS WEREN\\'T ALWAYS SO PROUD. EARLY IN MY CAREER, I PLAYED SMALL PARTS IN EVERY CRIME SHOW. I EVEN PLAYED TWO DIFFERENT CHARACTERS ON \"LAW AND ORDER.\" TITO CABASSA WHO LOOKED LIKE THIS. AND ONE YEAR LATER, I PLAYED REGGIE LUCKMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE THIS. AND THAT, MY FRIENDS, IS CALLED RANGE. BUT IT IS AMAZING TO BE HERE, LIKE I SAID. I WAS BORN IN CHILE, AND NINE MONTHS LATER, MY PARENTS FLED AND BROUGHT ME AND MY SISTER TO THE U.S. THEY WERE SO BRAVE, AND WITHOUT THEM, I WOULDN\\'T BE HERE IN THIS WONDERFUL COUNTRY, AND I CERTAINLY WOULDN\\'T BE STANDING HERE WITH YOU ALL TONIGHT. SO TO ALL MY FAMILY WATCHING IN CHILE, I WANT TO SAY [ SPEAKING NON-ENGLISH ] WHICH MEANS, I LOVE YOU, I MISS YOU, AND STOP GIVING OUT MY PHONE NUMBER. WE\\'VE GOT AN AMAZING SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.

       "[Document(page_content='We don\\'t have to look far to see how humanity\\'s fight against climate change might play out. Science fiction authors from around the world, writing from different traditions, coalesce on one point. A divided world, unable to fight the common threat. In Cixin Liu\\'s \"The Three-Body Problem\" trilogy, the threat of aliens from a dying planet invading to conquer Earth does not bring humanity together. Instead, a potent combination of fear, jingoism and competition for scarce resources among countries fractures the world into competing geoeconomic blocs centered around three powers: the United States, China and Europe. And none of these blocs succeed in staving off the alien invasion with, as you can imagine, disastrous consequences for the survival of humanity. Sorry for the spoilers about the books. (Laughter) In George Orwell\\'s \"1984,\" the world’s three superstates -- Oceania, Eurasia and East Asia -- fight each other in perpetuity in a disputed area located mostly around parts of Africa and the Middle East, where “the rest” reside. The realm of fiction is years ahead in anticipating important global currents. The International Monetary Fund’s “World Economic Outlook” describes an ongoing fragmentation of our global economy around four blocs: The United States, China, the European Union and the rest. This geoeconomic fragmentation may seriously hinder our ability to fight climate change by affecting the collective will to fight it. Because no individual, no group and certainly no nation state is self-sufficient in all of the resources, the finances and the manpower needed to reduce the rapid warming of our planet. We need collective action to invent and deploy at scale the technology solutions needed to reduce greenhouse gases in wealthy, high-emitting countries and to build systems in poorer, low-emitting countries to help them adapt to changing weather patterns. This is a three-part problem. Let us starts with the technoeconomic spheres of innovation. OK, I have to confess, even that is a mouthful for me. So let\\'s rephrase this a bit. Where in the world is innovation around low-carbon technologies happening? To slow down the speed of global warming, we need to deploy clean technology solutions around battery storage, renewable energy generation, etc., at scale in all reaches of the world. But the innovation around these crucial low-carbon technologies is happening in only a handful of countries. The world\\'s largest science and technology clusters, with the highest density of inventors and scientific authors, are concentrated in just three regions: North America, Europe and Asia. There is a danger here that the innovation and diffusion of these crucial low-carbon technologies will only happen among an exclusive group of allies, while excluding non-allies, especially the poorer countries. We are already seeing a trend of global public energy research and development budgets concentrated within these technoeconomic spheres of innovation: China, Europe and the United States. A second part of the problem is that we need to prioritize consumer gains and welfare. The commercialization of climate mitigation and adaptation technologies is essential for their global equitable deployment at scale. The mass production of clean energy hardware, electric vehicles, sustainable building materials and so on will encourage their widespread use. Access to large export markets will result in higher quality products and the creation of green jobs at home. Competition among producer firms will help push down prices for consumers and help raise living standards across the board, including in poorer countries. But if strict barriers to entry are placed on firms from rival geoeconomic blocs, there will be a cost to this lack of competition that is borne by ordinary people. Inefficiencies in the mass production of green technologies by firms with monopoly power in small but captive markets will neither reduce greenhouse gases, nor improve people\\'s quality of life. Imagine having to choose between maybe two or even one brand of highly overpriced electric vehicles or solar panels, when restrictions are placed on the imports of dozens of more affordable options from companies from around the world. This is the case currently with cell phones in some countries, where consumers are restricted to just two highly overpriced brands, or maybe even one. A third issue is that we need global standards to govern the sourcing of strategic materials. Strategic minerals, such as cobalt, copper, nickel and lithium are essential components for the manufacturing of solar panels that we all love, electric vehicles, wind turbines and other such clean energy, clean mobility hardware. These resources are nonrenewable. They are in finite supply and they are in high demand. By 2040, for instance, the demand for lithium is projected to grow 40-fold. For graphite, 25-fold. And for copper 21-fold. These minerals are often found in poorer countries, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo in Africa, Indonesia, Myanmar and the Philippines in Asia, and in fragile ecosystems such as our ocean floors. In a world of fiercely competing geoeconomic blocs, how will the race to access these scarce strategic minerals play out? Think about this for a second. The race to access strategic minerals from our ocean floors, destroying precious animal and plant species. Or a new space race to strip the moon of strategic minerals. I wish all of this was far-fetched, but it really is not. In fact, the history of the Democratic Republic of Congo is a cautionary tale of what a zero-sum race without guardrails to access precious human and natural resources could do. It was a competition among European empires that drove the transatlantic slave trade between the 16th and the 19th centuries that depopulated vast swaths of the Congo. The Shinkolobwe mine in the Congo was a source of two thirds of the uranium used in the atomic bomb that the United States dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, during World War II. Today, the Congo is a source of cobalt that makes its way to refineries in China for the manufacturing of batteries. We need global standards to prevent the destruction of our fragile ecosystem, such as our ocean floors, the moon and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Now an alternative scenario is actually possible. We can reject the dystopian future painted by Liu and Orwell if we consciously prioritize collective action on the key issues that matter. To do that, we need action on three fronts. Policymakers are the ones implementing radical protectionist policies to meet short-term political imperatives. They need to think carefully about the long-term consequences for their people, their economies and their societies that will persist long after their political tenures. Business leaders must consider whether atomized and insular markets are their preferred future. And finally, for us scholars, intellectuals and activists, we must identify and defend the values that matter most to us. We must advance continued improvements in human well-being, shared prosperity for everyone around the world, ecological balance and mutual coexistence. Thank you.
